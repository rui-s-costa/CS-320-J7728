# Module Eight Journal

CS-320-J7728 Software Test Automation& QA 23EW3


# Prompt
For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project to the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit the contact service files (Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java). From Project Two, submit the summary and reflections report. Together, these files showcase your work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These files also demonstrate your ability to create unit tests using code to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two, weaving together all of your answers.

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
* How do I approach designing software?

# Questions

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that code, program, or software is functional and secure, here  are a few key strategies I follow:

* Create and execute comprehensive testing plans that thoroughly exercise all aspects of the codebase, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

* Implement strong security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and data validation, to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.

* Regularly update and maintain the codebase, including fixing bugs and applying security patches, to ensure that it remains stable and secure over time.

* Use best practices in coding and software design, such as following coding conventions, commenting code, and writing clean, readable code that is easy to understand and maintain.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires a deep understanding of both the user and the problem being solved. To do this effectively, I do the following:

* Engage with users directly, through user research, surveys, and other feedback mechanisms, to gain a clear understanding of their needs and requirements.

* Use this information to inform the design of the program, creating user personas and user stories that capture the key features and functionality that users require.

* Continuously test and iterate on the program to ensure that it is meeting the needs of users and solving the problem effectively.

By following these steps, I can build a program that is user-centered and meets the needs of the people who will be using it.

## How do I approach designing software?

Designing software requires a combination of technical skill, creativity, and a deep understanding of the problem being solved. Here are some key steps I follow:

* Understand the problem and define the requirements: Gather input from stakeholders and define the problem to solve. Identify the key requirements that the software needs to meet.

* Plan and design the system: Create a high-level design of the system, including its components, interactions, and data flows.

* Develop a prototype: Build a functional prototype of the system that can be tested and iterated on.

* Test and refine: Test the prototype and iterate based on feedback from stakeholders and users.

* Build and deploy: Build the final version of the software and deploy it to users.

* Maintain and improve: Regularly update and maintain the software, addressing bugs and adding new features as necessary.

By following these steps, I can create software that is both functional and user-centered, and that solves the problem at hand effectively.
